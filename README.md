# Task-6-Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-the-Strength

## Tasks
In kali linux terminal

## Introduction
In this project, Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password against guessing or brute-force attacks. In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly.  The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, and unpredictability.

## Pre-requisites
- To ensure a strong password.
- Passwords should be at least 12 characters long, ideally 14 or more.
-  Avoid using personal information or common words.
-  Unique passwords for each account are also crucial. 

## Lab Set-up and Tools

### Tools
- **Kali Linux:** A Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.
- **Password meter:** A password strength meter is a tool that helps to evaluate how strong a password is in terms of its ability to resist hacking attempts. It usually gives a rating or score based on the combination of factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness of the password
                                                       
### Installation
Use online free password strength checkers (e.g., Passwordmeter.com)
